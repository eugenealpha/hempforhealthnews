<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://goo.gl/1mzLCa">The Best CBD Oil we have found.</a></p>
<p>Here at <strong>HFHN</strong> we&#8217;ve discovered the Sacred Plant CBD video series that tells the amazing story of the Cannabis plant. The series is an amazing presentation of the history and power of this amazing plant.</p>
<p>While the Sacred Plant CBD is not the main focus, it gives an incredible explanation of where medical science has progressed in understanding how The Sacred Plant is so helpful.</p>
<h2>Is Sacred Plant CBD Changing The Medical World</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sacred-plant-cbd.png" alt="sacred-plant-cbd" width="255" height="120" /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFRE6ojweBbb_sMZSlGM54g">The Sacred Plant video series</a><span style="font-size: 20px;"> brings up the very real issue of the pharmaceutical companies feeling Cannabis is a competitor. These are complicated issues and it&#8217;s frustrating for people who are just seeking relief. At HFHN we&#8217;ve always felt that education with Cannabis is crucial. Our favorite reader is one that has taken the time to educate themselves. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t always count on the world of western medicine to bring up a non-traditional solution.</span></p>
<h2>Will CBD Help Me?</h2>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the only honest answer anyone can give. Education is key to deciding if it&#8217;s right for you. Some things that might interest you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like anything else, there are some <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/2017/10/27/cbd-scams-dont-fall-for-these-3-tricks/">websites that are scamming people</a> buying CBD. It&#8217;s easy to prevent it happening to you.</li>
<li>Find a good quality CBD product you can trust. <a href="https://goo.gl/2WycDf">I recommend Receptra</a>. It&#8217;s the best quality CBD I have found and the price is very reasonable for the quality.</li>
<li><a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/3-things-you-must-know-before-buying-hemp-extracts/">Educate yourself!</a> You know it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re online reading this now. It really is an amazing education.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CBD Scams are happening daily</h2>
<p>With the popularity of CBD rising fast there will be people trying to take advantage of people seeking relief. It&#8217;s unfortunate that this happens, but there are always things we can do to protect ourselves.</p>
<h2>The Free CBD Scams</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-97" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil.png" alt="free cbd oil" width="800" height="408" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil.png 800w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil-300x153.png 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil-768x392.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />&#8220;Only the mousetrap has free cheese&#8221; is a good proverb to remember when tempted to take a company up on an offer of &#8220;Free CBD&#8221;. There are two main reasons these CBD Scams are created.</p>
<p>Some &#8220;Free&#8221; offers are actually a hidden subscription agreement. You give your credit card, they charge a small shipping and handling fee for the &#8220;free bottle&#8221;. What they don&#8217;t tell you is in the fine print you are agreeing to a subscription. The next month they charge you again, and again the next month.</p>
<h2>THE &#8220;NOT WORTH THE BOTTLE IT&#8217;S IN&#8221; CBD SCAMs</h2>
<p>Some &#8220;Free&#8221; offers are making money with shipping and handling. If you pay $12 for shipping and handling for a &#8220;Free&#8221; bottle of CBD you might be getting what you paid for.</p>
<p>A glass bottle, stopper, and label might cost $1. Fill it full of hemp seed oil from the grocery store that only costs you about twenty-five cents, and $3 to mail it puts the total cost at less than $5. So the company sending you &#8220;Free&#8221; oil makes over $7 with every &#8220;Free&#8221; bottle they mail out.</p>
<h2>TOO MUCH FOR TOO LITTLE CBD SCAMs</h2>
<p>When purchasing CBD it&#8217;s all about the milligrams you get. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you believe in isolate CBD or Full Spectrum Whole Plant CBD or even in Marijuana or Hemp CBD&#8230; at the end of the day any CBD you buy make sure you know what you are paying for the milligrams of CBD you are getting.</p>
<p>A large 3 oz bottle of CBD for only $49.99 might seem like a great deal. But if that bottle only contains 100 milligrams of CBD in those 3 ounces you are actually paying fifty cents a milligram for the CBD.</p>
<p>Another 2 oz bottle of CBD sells for $199.95. Much more expensive for a smaller bottle, but this bottle contains 3,000 milligrams of CBD. That&#8217;s $199.95 divided by 3,000 that gives us .06 cents per milligram. That&#8217;s a pretty good deal if you can get it for <a href="https://goo.gl/nsKCqY">pure CBD oil</a>.</p>
<h2>TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE&#8230; IT PROBABLY IS</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-94" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-1024x752.jpg" alt="CBD Scams" width="880" height="646" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-1024x752.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-300x220.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-768x564.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />As miraculous as the hemp plant is, remember if someone is trying to sell you something and your gut tells you this is too good a deal&#8230; follow your instincts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reputable Hemp CBD companies that are producing quality products at a fair price. Do your research and don&#8217;t be afraid to pick up the phone and call a company. I&#8217;m always impressed with the Receptra Naturals customer service team if you have a few minutes give them a call if you have hemp questions. They are in Denver Colorado and can be reached at 303.CBD.1663 (303.223.1663).</p>
<p>There are enough wonderful people who believe in the power of hemp to heal that are producing great products it&#8217;s likely you can <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/2017/07/12/3-things-you-must-know-before-buying-hemp-extracts/">find a quality product</a> that is right for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Is CBD Oil Safe?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-71" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re considering purchasing CBD Oil you need to be safe.</p>
<p>Safe means finding an honest CBD company that does testing of their CBD products.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard why it&#8217;s so important to have hemp products tested, here&#8217;s the reason:</p>
<p>Hemp has the ability to pull heavy metals from the soil and actually make the soil cleaner than before it grew there! Plants that do this are called remediation crops and other plants also clean the soil. The plant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatropha_curcas">Jatropha curcas</a> is very good at pulling copper from the soil.</p>
<p>But when companies are making hemp extracts, they want to make sure the hemp plant has not accumulated dangerous levels of these heavy metals.</p>
<p>This is why testing of CBD Oil products is so important. Make sure you purchase from a company that shows their test reports for <em>your actual product</em> on their website.</p>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve found a test result, or what they call in the manufacturing business a Certificate of Analysis (or CoA). How do you make sense of all the numbers?</p>
<p>This can be difficult because there is not a graphic standard that all CoA follow like the FDA supplement label. This means the numbers on one CoA might be in a different place on the page than another CoA. But here are a few things to look for when looking at a CBD companies CoA.</p>
<h2><strong>What product is the CoA actually for?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-75" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-1024x748.jpg" alt="is cbd safe" width="880" height="643" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-1024x748.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-300x219.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />Just because a company shows you a CoA doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the CoA for the product that you will receive. Check to make sure the CBD company you purchase from has a way to track each CoA to a specific product in their inventory. This means each product you purchase must have a &#8220;batch code&#8221; or some other identifier that will track your product back to a specific test. If products don&#8217;t have a code you can track back to a specific CoA avoid them. It&#8217;s the best way to make sure is cbd oil safe.</p>
<h2><strong>What does the CoA actually test for?</strong></h2>
<p>Because CoA are not standardized, there are no requirements of what companies must test for. Here is what you want to make sure your CBD Oil company tests for:</p>
<p>Potency<br />
Residual Solvents<br />
Yeasts, Coliforms, and Molds<br />
Heavy Metals</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what each of these test areas means and how to evaluate them.</p>
<p><strong>Potency</strong></p>
<p>Potency tells you how much CBD you are actually getting for your money. You want to make sure the test says the product contains the same amount of CBD that the product label says. Here&#8217;s an example of a potency section of a CBD company CoA:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-12 at 6.08.25 PM" width="807" height="173" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM.png 807w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM-300x64.png 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM-768x165.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>You can see this shows the amount of CBD and other cannabinoids that the product contains. There is a clear &#8220;Pass Value&#8221; and an indication if the test parameter was a pass or a fail.</p>
<p>If you have questions about a CBD company&#8217;s CoA just give them a call. They should be able to answer any questions you have about the CoA. It&#8217;s important. A CBD company you can trust will be available to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Solvents  </strong></p>
<p>Every hemp extract is made with a solvent. These solvents vary from food grade Ethanol (the same you would find in a red wine) to more harsh solvents like butane or even high-pressure carbon dioxide extractions done at extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>There are two concerns with residual solvents; what solvent is used and how much of that solvent is left in the finished product.</p>
<p>Which solvent used is a matter of personal preference. Ethanol extractions tend to be a &#8220;gentler&#8221; extraction method that produces a whole plant extraction. Other solvents are sometimes thought to be &#8220;cleaner&#8221; as they extract less of the &#8220;whole plant&#8221; and bring just the CBD.</p>
<p>Whichever solvent you decide, make sure the amount left in the extracted hemp is a safe amount. This is usually shown in a ppm or parts per million. Don&#8217;t worry about very small amounts of residual solvents as long as they are below acceptable levels.</p>
<p><strong>Yeasts, Coliforms, and Molds</strong></p>
<p>These are bad to have in hemp extract. Make sure there are none in your CBD oil.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Metals</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned how hemp can pull heavy metals from the soil. This is good for remediating contaminated soil, but not good for your CBD oil!</p>
<p>Make sure the CoA for your hemp product has tested for and is free from dangerous levels of unwanted heavy metals.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! Now you know how to read a CBD oil certificate of analysis.</p>
<p>Any questions? Leave them below in the comments, we try to respond to everyone.</p>

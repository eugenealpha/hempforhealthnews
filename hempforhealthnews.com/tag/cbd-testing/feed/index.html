				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CBD Scams are happening daily</h2>
<p>With the popularity of CBD rising fast there will be people trying to take advantage of people seeking relief. It&#8217;s unfortunate that this happens, but there are always things we can do to protect ourselves.</p>
<h2>The Free CBD Scams</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-97" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil.png" alt="free cbd oil" width="800" height="408" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil.png 800w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil-300x153.png 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/free-cbd-oil-768x392.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />&#8220;Only the mousetrap has free cheese&#8221; is a good proverb to remember when tempted to take a company up on an offer of &#8220;Free CBD&#8221;. There are two main reasons these CBD Scams are created.</p>
<p>Some &#8220;Free&#8221; offers are actually a hidden subscription agreement. You give your credit card, they charge a small shipping and handling fee for the &#8220;free bottle&#8221;. What they don&#8217;t tell you is in the fine print you are agreeing to a subscription. The next month they charge you again, and again the next month.</p>
<h2>THE &#8220;NOT WORTH THE BOTTLE IT&#8217;S IN&#8221; CBD SCAMs</h2>
<p>Some &#8220;Free&#8221; offers are making money with shipping and handling. If you pay $12 for shipping and handling for a &#8220;Free&#8221; bottle of CBD you might be getting what you paid for.</p>
<p>A glass bottle, stopper, and label might cost $1. Fill it full of hemp seed oil from the grocery store that only costs you about twenty-five cents, and $3 to mail it puts the total cost at less than $5. So the company sending you &#8220;Free&#8221; oil makes over $7 with every &#8220;Free&#8221; bottle they mail out.</p>
<h2>TOO MUCH FOR TOO LITTLE CBD SCAMs</h2>
<p>When purchasing CBD it&#8217;s all about the milligrams you get. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you believe in isolate CBD or Full Spectrum Whole Plant CBD or even in Marijuana or Hemp CBD&#8230; at the end of the day any CBD you buy make sure you know what you are paying for the milligrams of CBD you are getting.</p>
<p>A large 3 oz bottle of CBD for only $49.99 might seem like a great deal. But if that bottle only contains 100 milligrams of CBD in those 3 ounces you are actually paying fifty cents a milligram for the CBD.</p>
<p>Another 2 oz bottle of CBD sells for $199.95. Much more expensive for a smaller bottle, but this bottle contains 3,000 milligrams of CBD. That&#8217;s $199.95 divided by 3,000 that gives us .06 cents per milligram. That&#8217;s a pretty good deal if you can get it for <a href="https://goo.gl/nsKCqY">pure CBDÂ oil</a>.</p>
<h2>TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE&#8230; IT PROBABLY IS</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-94" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-1024x752.jpg" alt="CBD Scams" width="880" height="646" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-1024x752.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-300x220.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/54025195_xl-768x564.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />As miraculous as the hemp plant is, remember if someone is trying to sell you something and your gut tells you this is too good a deal&#8230; follow your instincts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reputable Hemp CBD companies that are producing quality products at a fair price. Do your research and don&#8217;t be afraid to pick up the phone and call a company. I&#8217;m always impressed with the Receptra Naturals customer service team if you have a few minutes give them a call if you have hemp questions. They are in Denver Colorado and can be reached at 303.CBD.1663 (303.223.1663).</p>
<p>There are enough wonderful people who believe in the power of hemp to heal that are producing great products it&#8217;s likely you can <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/2017/07/12/3-things-you-must-know-before-buying-hemp-extracts/">find a quality product</a> that is right for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not hard to find both scientific data and personal testimonials on the benefits of cannabidiol. We hear so many wonderful stories each day on how hemp extracts have helped people that had given up hope.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to know the downside of purchasing hemp extracts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_88" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-88" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-1024x685.jpg" alt="CBD Oil Industrial Hemp" width="880" height="589" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-300x201.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t buy CBD made with &#8220;Industrial Hemp&#8221;! That&#8217;s the type of hemp grown for rope, not CBD Oil!</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>1. ALL HEMP EXTRACTS MUST BE TESTED FOR CONTAMINATES</strong></h2>
<p>The hemp plant is well documented as a powerful remediation crop. With its deep roots, hemp pulls heavy metals from the ground it&#8217;s grown in. Even hemp grown using organic practices will <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669002000055">pull cadmium from the soil</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should NEVER buy CBD products that don&#8217;t display test results on their website. Don&#8217;t just assume because CBD companies use words like &#8220;Tested&#8221; and &#8220;Trusted&#8221; that they are doing complete tests on their products.</p>
<p>View the tests yourself and ask the company if you have any questions. Here are the type of tests you should see results for:</p>
<p>Heavy metals<br />
Molds, yeasts, and coliforms<br />
Residual solvents</p>

<h2><strong>2. CHECK THE COST PER MILLIGRAM</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-106" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd oil bottles" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />The price range for CBD products is all over the board. Some shady sites offer &#8220;free&#8221; CBD oil for $15 shipping and handling. Other companies sell bottles that exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get scammed by all the questionable CBD companies that are popping up. Here&#8217;s a guaranteed way to make sure you are getting a deal.</p>
<p>To find out the value of a CBD product do this quick calculation:</p>
<p>Total Price of Product / Total Number of Milligrams CBD</p>
<p>For example, a bottle with 250 milligrams of CBD that sold for $59 would be $59/250 = $0.236 or about 24 cents per milligram.</p>
<p>Another product selling for $199 with 3000 milligrams would be $199/3000 = $0.066 or about 7 cents per milligram.</p>
<p>This simple math will make sure you get a good deal!</p>
<h2><strong>3. TAKE ADVICE FROM A FRIEND</strong></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using CBD for over four years now. I&#8217;ve tried nearly 154 types of CBD. I&#8217;ve read articles and talked with company CEOs about their products.</p>
<p>After all this research I&#8217;ve picked what I believe is a CBD company that is doing everything right.</p>
<p>That company is Receptra Naturals.</p>
<p>They grow their own hemp on 100% family farms in Colorado. Their testing is the most transparent in the industry and their test results are remarkable.</p>
<p>And their prices are some of the most competitive out there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally spoken with the CEO and believe in their vision to help.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to try CBD products, There are three products I recommend.</p>
<p>If you are looking for hemp extract because of a health crisis or chronic condition, I suggest starting with their Receptra Prime. You can get a small bottle for as little as $39.95 but when you repurchase buy the bigger bottles because the price per milligram goes down as bottle size goes up.</p>
<p>If you are looking for hemp extract to enhance your physical performance, Receptra is your perfect choice. Start with the Receptra Elite. They have a cheaper product called Receptra Active, but go for the Elite. Receptra Elite includes turmeric as well as hemp extract. The Elite starts at $74.95 and comes in at only $0.07 per milligram including the turmeric!</p>
<p>The last Receptra product I would recommend to everyone is their Targeted Topical. This is a really special product. Packed with 400 milligrams of cannabinoids per ounce it&#8217;s the strongest topical I have found. If you ever have sore hands, feet, neck or knees get this product. It&#8217;s a steal at $39.95. Buy two!</p>
<p>Of course, all Receptra Naturals products are tested and the results for all of their <a href="https://goo.gl/YUP6m3">pure CBD oil</a> products are shown on the website.</p>
<p>Any questions or comments please ask them below! I try to respond to everyone!</p>

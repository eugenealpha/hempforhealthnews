<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-118" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-1024x671.jpg" alt="Can CBD oil for Dogs help with anxiety? " width="880" height="577" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-1024x671.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-300x197.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can CBD oil for Dogs help with anxiety?</figcaption></figure>
<p>National Public Radio did an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/07/04/535060331/some-marijuana-derived-treatments-aim-to-soothe-skittish-pets" target="_blank">article</a> about CBD and dogs with anxiety.  They found while some vets have found CBD to be a great treatment, many vets acknowledge that we just don&#8217;t have long-term studies on how CBD might affect canines.</p>
<p>Since CBD is non-toxic and has been tested in dogs in short-term studies with no negative effects owners that feel a more &#8220;natural&#8221; approach than giving your nervous family member a medication, CBD oil for dogs is a great place to start. As long as you <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/cbd-dogs-can-help-important-thing-know-giving-dog-cbd/" target="_blank">get your dog&#8217;s CBD from an outstanding company</a> it&#8217;s a pretty safe way to try and ease some anxiety that dogs can get from fireworks, strange surroundings, thunderstorms and even unknown household guests.</p>
<h2>CBD OIL FOR DOGS WITH PAIN</h2>
<figure style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-117" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd oil for dogs" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Some pet owners are trying CBD Oil For Older Dogs.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s the great news; for owners that feel a more &#8220;natural&#8221; approach than giving your older family member pain relievers, CBD oil for dogs is a great place to start. As long as you <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/cbd-dogs-can-help-important-thing-know-giving-dog-cbd/" target="_blank">get your dog&#8217;s CBD from an outstanding company</a> it&#8217;s a pretty safe way to try and ease some suffering we all get as we get older.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a great addition to those pills the vet gives you. Some CBD oil for dogs users have found they can cut back or even stop other pills after starting their dog on CBD.</p>
<p>Of course consulting with your vet before starting any change with your dog is a great idea. While the news is spreading fast don&#8217;t be surprised if your vet hasn&#8217;t heard or thinks CBD is untested.</p>
<h2>CBD Oil For Dogs with Seizures</h2>
<figure id="attachment_120" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-120" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-1024x684.jpg" alt="cbd oil for dogs with seizures" width="880" height="588" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;ve heard stories of dogs with seizures having amazing success.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is perhaps the best-known benefit of CBD. We&#8217;ve heard stories of it stopping seizures when nothing else would in both people and humans. If you have a dog with seizures get your vet to approve some CBD as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>How to pick a CBD Company for your Dog&#8217;s CBD?</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Is CBD For Dogs?</h2>
<p>You might have heard a few things about CBD for dogs. Good dog owners do a little research before we give our furry friends something new and we&#8217;ve combined what every dog owner should know about CBD for dogs.</p>
<h2>Can CBD for Dogs be harmful?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-62" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd for dogs with pain" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />Here&#8217;s the great news: CBD is non-toxic.</p>
<p>But dogs can be very sensitive to cannabinoids, so it&#8217;s best to start with a low dose, and slowly increase it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the other funny thing about CBD; it has what&#8217;s called a <a href="http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/26/3/532.short" target="_blank">biphasic dose response</a>. The simple way to explain it is &#8220;taking more CBD doesn&#8217;t make it work better&#8221;. Think of it this way; aspirin doesn&#8217;t work like CBD. The more aspirin you take, the more relief you feel.  Take one for a little pain, take two for more pain.</p>
<p>With CBD the perfect dose might be one and a half pills. At that dose, you get the full effect. If you took two pills it might actually feel less effective than the one and a half pills.</p>
<h2>Find a Good Quality CBD Oil Liquid for Dogs</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-61" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-1024x734.jpg" alt="Benefits of CBD for Dogs" width="880" height="631" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-1024x734.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-300x215.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-768x551.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />A good benefit of CBD for dogs in a quality tincture is the ability to dose in drops. This is particularly important with small dogs that require a small dose of CBD.</p>
<p>And sometimes treat makers spray a CBD liquid on the treats after they are produced. This can cause irregularities in how much CBD is actually in each treat.</p>
<p>Most CBD oils for dogs are mixed with an oil like MCT which is a great choice even for dogs with the most sensitive stomachs. Drops also give you the chance to add the CBD to picky eaters favorite foods.</p>
<h2>LOOK FOR CBD TEST RESULTS FOR THE PRODUCT</h2>
<p>Hemp is a great reclamation plant. That means it pulls heavy metals from the soil it grows in. Wonderful if you&#8217;re trying to clean up some land, but this is why all hemp CBD products need to be tested.</p>
<p>When looking for the best cbd for dogs, make sure you can view the actual test result from the batch of hemp oil your product was made with. These are often called Certificates of Analysis or COA and are often displayed online for your review.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure they test for heavy metals like lead, residual solvents, yeasts, molds, and coliforms.</p>
<p>The COA should also tell you exactly how much CBD is in the bottle and each dose.</p>
<h2>Does CBD Actually Work for Dogs?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-63" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd dog oil" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />There are many things that people are treating their dogs with CBD. We&#8217;ve heard stories of it helping dramatically with seizures. Older dogs with painful hips from hip dysplasia can sometimes get some dramatic relief. CBD has been shown to help with inflammation so any issue related to that it&#8217;s worth trying CBD for. CBD for Dogs with Anxiety has also been a widely reported use.</p>
<p>Our favorite <a href="https://goo.gl/CHA7LZ" target="_blank">CBD for Dogs is Receptra Naturals Pet</a>. They have test results right on the website, and they make a really quality product that we give our dogs daily.</p>

<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-118" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-1024x671.jpg" alt="Can CBD oil for Dogs help with anxiety? " width="880" height="577" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-1024x671.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-300x197.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/54185208_xxl-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can CBD oil for Dogs help with anxiety?</figcaption></figure>
<p>National Public Radio did an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/07/04/535060331/some-marijuana-derived-treatments-aim-to-soothe-skittish-pets" target="_blank">article</a> about CBD and dogs with anxiety.  They found while some vets have found CBD to be a great treatment, many vets acknowledge that we just don&#8217;t have long-term studies on how CBD might affect canines.</p>
<p>Since CBD is non-toxic and has been tested in dogs in short-term studies with no negative effects owners that feel a more &#8220;natural&#8221; approach than giving your nervous family member a medication, CBD oil for dogs is a great place to start. As long as you <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/cbd-dogs-can-help-important-thing-know-giving-dog-cbd/" target="_blank">get your dog&#8217;s CBD from an outstanding company</a> it&#8217;s a pretty safe way to try and ease some anxiety that dogs can get from fireworks, strange surroundings, thunderstorms and even unknown household guests.</p>
<h2>CBD OIL FOR DOGS WITH PAIN</h2>
<figure style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-117" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd oil for dogs" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/27592628_xl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Some pet owners are trying CBD Oil For Older Dogs.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s the great news; for owners that feel a more &#8220;natural&#8221; approach than giving your older family member pain relievers, CBD oil for dogs is a great place to start. As long as you <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/cbd-dogs-can-help-important-thing-know-giving-dog-cbd/" target="_blank">get your dog&#8217;s CBD from an outstanding company</a> it&#8217;s a pretty safe way to try and ease some suffering we all get as we get older.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a great addition to those pills the vet gives you. Some CBD oil for dogs users have found they can cut back or even stop other pills after starting their dog on CBD.</p>
<p>Of course consulting with your vet before starting any change with your dog is a great idea. While the news is spreading fast don&#8217;t be surprised if your vet hasn&#8217;t heard or thinks CBD is untested.</p>
<h2>CBD Oil For Dogs with Seizures</h2>
<figure id="attachment_120" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-120" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-1024x684.jpg" alt="cbd oil for dogs with seizures" width="880" height="588" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/32431867_xxl-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;ve heard stories of dogs with seizures having amazing success.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is perhaps the best-known benefit of CBD. We&#8217;ve heard stories of it stopping seizures when nothing else would in both people and humans. If you have a dog with seizures get your vet to approve some CBD as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>How to pick a CBD Company for your Dog&#8217;s CBD?</h2>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when choosing a CBD Oil for Dogs. We&#8217;ve put together a quick read that should help you out:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Is CBD For Dogs?</h2>
<p>You might have heard a few things about CBD for dogs. Good dog owners do a little research before we give our furry friends something new and we&#8217;ve combined what every dog owner should know about CBD for dogs.</p>
<h2>Can CBD for Dogs be harmful?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-62" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd for dogs with pain" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39721869_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />Here&#8217;s the great news: CBD is non-toxic.</p>
<p>But dogs can be very sensitive to cannabinoids, so it&#8217;s best to start with a low dose, and slowly increase it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the other funny thing about CBD; it has what&#8217;s called a <a href="http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/26/3/532.short" target="_blank">biphasic dose response</a>. The simple way to explain it is &#8220;taking more CBD doesn&#8217;t make it work better&#8221;. Think of it this way; aspirin doesn&#8217;t work like CBD. The more aspirin you take, the more relief you feel.  Take one for a little pain, take two for more pain.</p>
<p>With CBD the perfect dose might be one and a half pills. At that dose, you get the full effect. If you took two pills it might actually feel less effective than the one and a half pills.</p>
<h2>Find a Good Quality CBD Oil Liquid for Dogs</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-61" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-1024x734.jpg" alt="Benefits of CBD for Dogs" width="880" height="631" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-1024x734.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-300x215.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/39484879_xxl-768x551.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />A good benefit of CBD for dogs in a quality tincture is the ability to dose in drops. This is particularly important with small dogs that require a small dose of CBD.</p>
<p>And sometimes treat makers spray a CBD liquid on the treats after they are produced. This can cause irregularities in how much CBD is actually in each treat.</p>
<p>Most CBD oils for dogs are mixed with an oil like MCT which is a great choice even for dogs with the most sensitive stomachs. Drops also give you the chance to add the CBD to picky eaters favorite foods.</p>
<h2>LOOK FOR CBD TEST RESULTS FOR THE PRODUCT</h2>
<p>Hemp is a great reclamation plant. That means it pulls heavy metals from the soil it grows in. Wonderful if you&#8217;re trying to clean up some land, but this is why all hemp CBD products need to be tested.</p>
<p>When looking for the best cbd for dogs, make sure you can view the actual test result from the batch of hemp oil your product was made with. These are often called Certificates of Analysis or COA and are often displayed online for your review.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure they test for heavy metals like lead, residual solvents, yeasts, molds, and coliforms.</p>
<p>The COA should also tell you exactly how much CBD is in the bottle and each dose.</p>
<h2>Does CBD Actually Work for Dogs?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-63" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd dog oil" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29866418_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />There are many things that people are treating their dogs with CBD. We&#8217;ve heard stories of it helping dramatically with seizures. Older dogs with painful hips from hip dysplasia can sometimes get some dramatic relief. CBD has been shown to help with inflammation so any issue related to that it&#8217;s worth trying CBD for. CBD for Dogs with Anxiety has also been a widely reported use.</p>
<p>Our favorite <a href="https://goo.gl/CHA7LZ" target="_blank">CBD for Dogs is Receptra Naturals Pet</a>. They have test results right on the website, and they make a really quality product that we give our dogs daily.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://goo.gl/1mzLCa">The Best CBD Oil we have found.</a></p>
<p>Here at <strong>HFHN</strong> we&#8217;ve discovered the Sacred Plant CBD video series that tells the amazing story of the Cannabis plant. The series is an amazing presentation of the history and power of this amazing plant.</p>
<p>While the Sacred Plant CBD is not the main focus, it gives an incredible explanation of where medical science has progressed in understanding how The Sacred Plant is so helpful.</p>
<h2>Is Sacred Plant CBD Changing The Medical World</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sacred-plant-cbd.png" alt="sacred-plant-cbd" width="255" height="120" /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFRE6ojweBbb_sMZSlGM54g">The Sacred Plant video series</a><span style="font-size: 20px;"> brings up the very real issue of the pharmaceutical companies feeling Cannabis is a competitor. These are complicated issues and it&#8217;s frustrating for people who are just seeking relief. At HFHN we&#8217;ve always felt that education with Cannabis is crucial. Our favorite reader is one that has taken the time to educate themselves. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t always count on the world of western medicine to bring up a non-traditional solution.</span></p>
<h2>Will CBD Help Me?</h2>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the only honest answer anyone can give. Education is key to deciding if it&#8217;s right for you. Some things that might interest you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like anything else, there are some <a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/2017/10/27/cbd-scams-dont-fall-for-these-3-tricks/">websites that are scamming people</a> buying CBD. It&#8217;s easy to prevent it happening to you.</li>
<li>Find a good quality CBD product you can trust. <a href="https://goo.gl/2WycDf">I recommend Receptra</a>. It&#8217;s the best quality CBD I have found and the price is very reasonable for the quality.</li>
<li><a href="http://hempforhealthnews.com/3-things-you-must-know-before-buying-hemp-extracts/">Educate yourself!</a> You know it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re online reading this now. It really is an amazing education.</li>

<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-71" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/64216815_xxl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re considering purchasing CBD Oil you need to be safe.</p>
<p>Safe means finding an honest CBD company that does testing of their CBD products.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard why it&#8217;s so important to have hemp products tested, here&#8217;s the reason:</p>
<p>Hemp has the ability to pull heavy metals from the soil and actually make the soil cleaner than before it grew there! Plants that do this are called remediation crops and other plants also clean the soil. The plant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatropha_curcas">Jatropha curcas</a> is very good at pulling copper from the soil.</p>
<p>But when companies are making hemp extracts, they want to make sure the hemp plant has not accumulated dangerous levels of these heavy metals.</p>
<p>This is why testing of CBD Oil products is so important. Make sure you purchase from a company that shows their test reports for <em>your actual product</em> on their website.</p>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve found a test result, or what they call in the manufacturing business a Certificate of Analysis (or CoA). How do you make sense of all the numbers?</p>
<p>This can be difficult because there is not a graphic standard that all CoA follow like the FDA supplement label. This means the numbers on one CoA might be in a different place on the page than another CoA. But here are a few things to look for when looking at a CBD companies CoA.</p>
<h2><strong>What product is the CoA actually for?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-75" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-1024x748.jpg" alt="is cbd safe" width="880" height="643" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-1024x748.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-300x219.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/49695744_xxl-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />Just because a company shows you a CoA doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the CoA for the product that you will receive. Check to make sure the CBD company you purchase from has a way to track each CoA to a specific product in their inventory. This means each product you purchase must have a &#8220;batch code&#8221; or some other identifier that will track your product back to a specific test. If products don&#8217;t have a code you can track back to a specific CoA avoid them. It&#8217;s the best way to make sure is cbd oil safe.</p>
<h2><strong>What does the CoA actually test for?</strong></h2>
<p>Because CoA are not standardized, there are no requirements of what companies must test for. Here is what you want to make sure your CBD Oil company tests for:</p>
<p>Potency<br />
Residual Solvents<br />
Yeasts, Coliforms, and Molds<br />
Heavy Metals</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what each of these test areas means and how to evaluate them.</p>
<p><strong>Potency</strong></p>
<p>Potency tells you how much CBD you are actually getting for your money. You want to make sure the test says the product contains the same amount of CBD that the product label says. Here&#8217;s an example of a potency section of a CBD company CoA:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-12 at 6.08.25 PM" width="807" height="173" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM.png 807w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM-300x64.png 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-6.08.25-PM-768x165.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>You can see this shows the amount of CBD and other cannabinoids that the product contains. There is a clear &#8220;Pass Value&#8221; and an indication if the test parameter was a pass or a fail.</p>
<p>If you have questions about a CBD company&#8217;s CoA just give them a call. They should be able to answer any questions you have about the CoA. It&#8217;s important. A CBD company you can trust will be available to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Solvents  </strong></p>
<p>Every hemp extract is made with a solvent. These solvents vary from food grade Ethanol (the same you would find in a red wine) to more harsh solvents like butane or even high-pressure carbon dioxide extractions done at extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>There are two concerns with residual solvents; what solvent is used and how much of that solvent is left in the finished product.</p>
<p>Which solvent used is a matter of personal preference. Ethanol extractions tend to be a &#8220;gentler&#8221; extraction method that produces a whole plant extraction. Other solvents are sometimes thought to be &#8220;cleaner&#8221; as they extract less of the &#8220;whole plant&#8221; and bring just the CBD.</p>
<p>Whichever solvent you decide, make sure the amount left in the extracted hemp is a safe amount. This is usually shown in a ppm or parts per million. Don&#8217;t worry about very small amounts of residual solvents as long as they are below acceptable levels.</p>
<p><strong>Yeasts, Coliforms, and Molds</strong></p>
<p>These are bad to have in hemp extract. Make sure there are none in your CBD oil.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Metals</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned how hemp can pull heavy metals from the soil. This is good for remediating contaminated soil, but not good for your CBD oil!</p>
<p>Make sure the CoA for your hemp product has tested for and is free from dangerous levels of unwanted heavy metals.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! Now you know how to read a CBD oil certificate of analysis.</p>
<p>Any questions? Leave them below in the comments, we try to respond to everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not hard to find both scientific data and personal testimonials on the benefits of cannabidiol. We hear so many wonderful stories each day on how hemp extracts have helped people that had given up hope.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to know the downside of purchasing hemp extracts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_88" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-large wp-image-88" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-1024x685.jpg" alt="CBD Oil Industrial Hemp" width="880" height="589" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-300x201.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/74589807_xxl-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t buy CBD made with &#8220;Industrial Hemp&#8221;! That&#8217;s the type of hemp grown for rope, not CBD Oil!</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>1. ALL HEMP EXTRACTS MUST BE TESTED FOR CONTAMINATES</strong></h2>
<p>The hemp plant is well documented as a powerful remediation crop. With its deep roots, hemp pulls heavy metals from the ground it&#8217;s grown in. Even hemp grown using organic practices will <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669002000055">pull cadmium from the soil</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should NEVER buy CBD products that don&#8217;t display test results on their website. Don&#8217;t just assume because CBD companies use words like &#8220;Tested&#8221; and &#8220;Trusted&#8221; that they are doing complete tests on their products.</p>
<p>View the tests yourself and ask the company if you have any questions. Here are the type of tests you should see results for:</p>
<p>Heavy metals<br />
Molds, yeasts, and coliforms<br />
Residual solvents</p>

<h2><strong>2. CHECK THE COST PER MILLIGRAM</strong></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-106" src="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-1024x683.jpg" alt="cbd oil bottles" width="880" height="587" srcset="http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-300x200.jpg 300w, http://hempforhealthnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/68702324_xl-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" />The price range for CBD products is all over the board. Some shady sites offer &#8220;free&#8221; CBD oil for $15 shipping and handling. Other companies sell bottles that exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get scammed by all the questionable CBD companies that are popping up. Here&#8217;s a guaranteed way to make sure you are getting a deal.</p>
<p>To find out the value of a CBD product do this quick calculation:</p>
<p>Total Price of Product / Total Number of Milligrams CBD</p>
<p>For example, a bottle with 250 milligrams of CBD that sold for $59 would be $59/250 = $0.236 or about 24 cents per milligram.</p>
<p>Another product selling for $199 with 3000 milligrams would be $199/3000 = $0.066 or about 7 cents per milligram.</p>
<p>This simple math will make sure you get a good deal!</p>
<h2><strong>3. TAKE ADVICE FROM A FRIEND</strong></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using CBD for over four years now. I&#8217;ve tried nearly 154 types of CBD. I&#8217;ve read articles and talked with company CEOs about their products.</p>
<p>After all this research I&#8217;ve picked what I believe is a CBD company that is doing everything right.</p>
<p>That company is Receptra Naturals.</p>
<p>They grow their own hemp on 100% family farms in Colorado. Their testing is the most transparent in the industry and their test results are remarkable.</p>
<p>And their prices are some of the most competitive out there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally spoken with the CEO and believe in their vision to help.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to try CBD products, There are three products I recommend.</p>
<p>If you are looking for hemp extract because of a health crisis or chronic condition, I suggest starting with their Receptra Prime. You can get a small bottle for as little as $39.95 but when you repurchase buy the bigger bottles because the price per milligram goes down as bottle size goes up.</p>
<p>If you are looking for hemp extract to enhance your physical performance, Receptra is your perfect choice. Start with the Receptra Elite. They have a cheaper product called Receptra Active, but go for the Elite. Receptra Elite includes turmeric as well as hemp extract. The Elite starts at $74.95 and comes in at only $0.07 per milligram including the turmeric!</p>
<p>The last Receptra product I would recommend to everyone is their Targeted Topical. This is a really special product. Packed with 400 milligrams of cannabinoids per ounce it&#8217;s the strongest topical I have found. If you ever have sore hands, feet, neck or knees get this product. It&#8217;s a steal at $39.95. Buy two!</p>
<p>Of course, all Receptra Naturals products are tested and the results for all of their <a href="https://goo.gl/YUP6m3">pure CBD oil</a> products are shown on the website.</p>
<p>Any questions or comments please ask them below! I try to respond to everyone!</p>
